*  PORT defines the target platform: DOS, WINDOWS, UNIX, or EMBEDDED
*
*  PORT = DOS      means a 16-bit DOS console-mode application
*
*  PORT = WINDOWS  means a 32-bit WIN32 console-mode application for
*                  Windows 95, 98, 2000, ME or NT.  On NT this will use the
*                  DeviceIoControl() API to access the Parallel Port.
*
*  PORT = UNIX     means any UNIX system.  BitBlaster access is support via
*                  the standard ANSI system calls open(), read(), write().
*                  The ByteBlaster is not supported.
*
*  PORT = EMBEDDED means all DOS, WINDOWS, and UNIX code is excluded. 
*                  Remaining code supports 16 and 32-bit compilers. 
*                  Additional porting steps may be necessary. See readme 
*                  file for more details.
